      dedicated blog on my beautiful state Chhattisgarh , most of us know Chhattisgarh for the root cause problem of 
      naxalites but this is not the end , there are certain facts and figures that indicates that although it's a tribal 
      state (majority of it's people belong to tribal communities) but it also contributes positively for the development
      of our Nation. So, I thought of documenting the facts and figures that I am aware about my beautiful state Chhattisgarh.
      Also, after reading this blog post you will came to know about several tourist attractions present in the state, so 
      whenever you will get time do visit those places and I guarantee , that experience would be wonderful and awesome.
